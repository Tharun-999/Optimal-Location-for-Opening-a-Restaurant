    "While opening a resturant can be a very lucrative business, a lack of demand causes many resturants to close within the first year of opening. There are many different factors that can account for a resturant's success such as location, competition,and quality of the food. \n",

    "The goal of this project is to use the Foursquare API to determine the optimal location to open an Indian Restaurant. For Indian Restaurant specifically, location and competition are both determined by where the restaurant will be opened. If there are too many Indian Restaurants in the local vicinity, the profitability of the restaurant will be severily decreased. Additionally, starting a restaurant in a location with higher income would increase the profitability of the business over starting in a poorer area. \n",
